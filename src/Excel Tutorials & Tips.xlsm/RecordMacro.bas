'   RECORD MACRO
'
'       Sometimes we don't know the code or synthax we need in order to do what we ant to to
'       There is an excellent website we can use to help us figure it out....  www.google.com
'
'       If google hasn't got the answer, you can use "Record Macro" (in the Developer Tab)
'
'       Before you record a macro, you must give it a name, a location to record it (use This Workbook) and an optional description (which will be added as a comment)
'
'       When you are Recording a macro, any changes you make on a worksheet such as formatting, entering a formula, inserting a row etc.
'       are all recorded in the form of a macro.
'
'       Once you have finished what you want to record, press "Stop Recording".
'       Your macro will be saved in one of your modules
'
'       The macro can then be run to repeat the actions that you just did
'       or it can be examined and code can be extracted from it for use in another macro.
